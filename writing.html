            <h3>The Veldt Poster</h3>
            <p>In Web Applications, I read a short story called The Veldt, written by Ray Bradbury, a cautionary story about the threatening effects of technology. Set in the future, the story follows a typical family of four as the readers explore their daily life and discover the way technology changed their family dynamic. To convey that I was capable of analyzing text and communicating it clearly in a simplistic way,  I created a poster on the effects of technology on the family using quotes from the story. Using expository writing techniques, I found two quotes that I felt were the more effective examples to showcase, along with images that assisted in expressing the message. </p>

            <h3>The Red Balloon</h3>
            <p>The Red Balloon Newspaper is an assignment designed to showcase my skills in journalistic writing. In the assignment, I created a fictional newspaper outlet whose purpose is to outline and appreciate different aspects of film that might have been overlooked by viewers. In this particular section of the newspaper, I summarized the short film, The Red Balloon, directed and written by Albert Lamorisse, and described an interpretation of the theme Lamorisse could have intended to express. In this assignment, I practiced writing in third person with the demographics of my audience in mind.</p>
