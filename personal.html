            <h3>Coco Nails</h3>
            <p>Coco Nails website is a personal project designed to advertise and promote a local nail salon in Clovis. I was requested by the owner to create a website that included all of their services, showcased their past work, and provided information about the salon to customers.  Using my skills and knowledge in design principles, I created a bright and colorful palette that made the site feel inviting while including every aspect requested by the owner. I selected this sample because I spent a lot of time devising a plan for the design, as well as time spent developing the website in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is a great example of my skills and what I can accomplish. </p>

            <p>Beauty Belles is a business card I designed in 2022 for a small business that sells Korean and Japanese beauty products. The owner approached me to design her a business card that would attract customers and provide them with the necessary information to contact her, or shop from her website. Taking her personality into account, I designed a card that would resemble her the best, as this particular small business relied heavily on presentation. I created two versions, one with a dark background, one with a light background. I presented both versions to the owner and she loved them both. Ultimately, she distributed the dark cards and was able to jump start her business. This was the first professional design project that I am proud of and I was happy to take part in the owner’s business. </p>
