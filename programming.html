        <p>Project Layout was assigned to me as a representation of real-world front end development. I was given a prototype designed by a graphic designer and was tasked to code the website, using HTML and CSS, identical to the prototype. This project was also designed for me to practice my skills with flexbox and CSS positioning. It challenged my abilities in attention to details and investigation as I had to replicate every single aspect of the prototype I was given. The most challenging part of the project was positioning a form on top of an image as I was unfamiliar with the concept; however, with persistence, I managed to complete the task.  <button class="btn"><a class="weblink" href="">Visit Website</a></button></p>

        </div>
        <p>Project Reduce is a collaborative project created to address and inform people about the issues of waste and encourage them to make changes on an individual level that will help manage the issue. For the first part of the project, different student programmers would code my website based on my Figma prototype and I would facilitate their work, making sure that all programmers were on the same page and that the website was cohesive. We utilized GitHub to save code so that I and others are able to work on the project on different devices as well as to track everyone’s contributions to the site. During the second half of the project, I was tasked to code the incomplete pages of the website on my own. I used languages HTML and CSS and made my site mobile compatible. While programming with HTML and CSS, I became more familiar with concepts such as flexboxes, web typography, and responsive images. This was a major project that consisted of many learning curves and challenges as it was one of the first websites I had created. Using CART’s “Habits of Mind,” I collaborated with other students to build a functional website while investigating the different ways they code and learning from them. In doing so, I was able to create a website identical to what I had envisioned. <button class="btn"><a class="weblink" href="">Visit Website</a></button></p>

         <img src="images/16.9.png" alt="">
      </div>
      <p>Happy Little Dinosaurs was the latest project I worked on and the most intricate. I had to reflect back on everything I learned about HTML, CSS and JavaScript and implement those skills into a reimagined, adapted game of Happy Little Dinosaurs by Unstable Games. My partners and I had plenty to think about when we were trying to turn a board/card game into a digital version. More than any of the other previous projects, user usability was the most complicated. We had to take input errors into account and make sure that the game was clear and unstandable to play. This was mainly solved utilizing JavaScript. We familiarize ourselves with if statements, for loops, splice method and other concepts to reduce mistakes in user inputs. Through JavaScript, we had also built a functional AI that acts as the user’s opponent. Since this was a group project, communication was key to a successful game. My team and I had multiple discussions about the challenges we were facing or the unaccounted issues that arose to find solutions. We brainstormed, collaborated and spoke our minds until we had the best solution to any problem. <button class="btn"><a class="weblink" href="">Visit Website</a></button></p>

        </div>
        <p>Visai Budget Project was created, in partnership with the EECU Wise Up program, to encourage and educate students about saving and budgeting with their futures in mind. I was tasked to create a calculator that would calculate tax rates, monthly and annual incomes and monthly house payment in accordance to the user's hypothetical careers. Using JavaScript for the first time, I managed to create a functional calculator that worked to its intended purpose, however, there were some challenges that I encountered. Though I had some lessons on JavaScript beforehand, I found it difficult to connect my JavaScript code with my HTML code. I had a difficult time taking initiative as I had no idea where I would start. However, when I did take initiative, I investigated resources such W3Schools and Mozilla that answered a couple of my questions and helped me build a foundation for my code. Through trial and error and with practice and persistence, I was able to get JavaScript and HTML to work cohesively together and I picked up some fundamental JavaScript concepts that would assist me in the next project. <button class="btn"><a class="weblink" href="">Visit Website</a></button></p>
