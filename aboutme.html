    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> I am Vietnamese, born and raised in the United States. Both of my parents were immigrants, building their own life from the ground up, meaning, they had always taught me the importance of hard work and opportunities.  In the sections below, I have highlighted my most recent and significant achievements, a few of my hobbies and interests, and my future plans to further enhance my education.</p>

        <h3>Post Secondary Plan</h3>
        <p>After graduating high school, I plan to attend CSU Long Beach striving to earn a bachelor degree in biology. After attending a 4-year university, I hope to be accepted into an optometry school to pursue a doctorate degree in optometry. In the future, I intend on opening my own eye care practice in the Central Valley. Since there is a large proportion of people with visual impairment outnumbering the amount of optometrists in the Central Valley, I hope to help relieve the ratio while providing affordable care to my patients. </p>
